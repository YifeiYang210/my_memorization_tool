## Introduction

Work with the SQLAlchemy ORM and an SQLite database to create a tool for memorizing. Practice loops, lists, and various string methods.

It would be great to remember anything at any time. Alas, our mental capacity is limited. The good thing is that there are a lot of tools to help us memorize things. In this project, we are going to create a tool for memorizing lines, poems, speeches, and other text-based materials.

## What you'll learn

Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Hereâ€™s what awaits you:
1. Make your own flashcards.
2. Store your flashcards in the database.
3. Add a way to update and delete the flashcards to your program.
4. Implement the Leitner system to your program to improve the efficiency of memorizing.

Other features will be coming soon!
